# Blocitoff

Blocitoff is a todo list app. I know what you're thinking. "Why's this numbskull making another todo list app?" Well, Blocitoff is different. Blocitoff knows how cluttered your todo list is. It's clever like that. It also knows that if a task isn't important enough to be completed in 7 days, it's probably not important enough to clutter your todo list. So Blocitoff takes the liberty of deleting those cluttering tasks for you.

#### The Tech

Blocitoff uses Ruby on Rails to keep your todo list current and simple to use. It uses AJAX requests to keep things snappy, Bootstrap to keep things pretty, and the Devise gem to keep users authenticated. It uses SQLite3 to keep your tasks in nice, neat tables.
